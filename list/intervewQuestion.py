'''
2.1 Remove Dups:
	Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
	FOLLOW UP:
		How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
'''



'''
2.2 Return Kth to Last:
	Implement an algroithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

'''


'''
2.3 Delete Middle Node:
	Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a dsingly linked list
	given only access to that node.
	EX:
	Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
	Output: nothing is returned but the new linked list is a->b->d->e
'''


'''
2.4 Partition:
	Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x 
	come before all node greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the 
	values of x only need to be after the elements less than x
	Ex:
	Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
	Ouput: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
